## Kick-off is a platform to connect summer interns with startups

###Why?
After a long and intensive search for a great internship opportunity for the summer, we realized that there is no such thing as a f_cking cool platform to simplify such a hard task - you know the drill. 
So together with JOBBOX.io we are working hard to create the perfect tool to match the perfect intern (you!) with the perfect European startup. If you want to make more out of your summer and youâ€™re looking to kick-off your future, then this is your time to shine at Kick-off.io!

###For Who?
Kick-off.io was made for tech students to use and abuse in their persuit of a happy summer internship. We have dedicated our time to create a space where startups and tech students will be able to find the best match for each other. You just need apply and we will take care of finding the startup that fits you best.
If you are a Startup  looking for awesome interns then contact us so that we can add you to Kick-off.io.
